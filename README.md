# Predicting-Traffic-Flow

This repository contains code for predicting traffic flow using various regression models. The dataset used includes information about the number of vehicles passing through different junctions at various times.

# Overview

Traffic flow prediction plays a crucial role in urban planning, traffic management, and infrastructure development. Accurate predictions can help authorities optimize traffic signal timings, plan road maintenance, and improve overall transportation efficiency. This project aims to develop and compare regression models to predict traffic flow based on factors such as date, time, and junction location.

# Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
SciPy
Plotly
Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive data analysis)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy plotly jupyter


# Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical records of traffic flow at different junctions. Each record includes the following features:

- DateTime: Timestamp indicating the date and time of the observation.
- Junction: Identifier for the junction where the traffic flow was recorded.
- Vehicles: Number of vehicles passing through the junction at the specified time.
- ID: Unique identifier for each record.

# Data Preprocessing

Before training the regression models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to extract relevant features and ensure data quality. This preprocessing includes:

- Converting the `DateTime` column to a datetime format for easy manipulation.
- Extracting additional features such as year, month, day, hour, and minute from the timestamp to capture temporal patterns.
- Excluding non-numeric columns before correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.

#Regression Models

Several regression models are implemented and evaluated for traffic flow prediction:

1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful regression technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
In this project, Linear Regression is applied to predict traffic flow based on features such as junction location, date, and time.
2. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function to prevent overfitting.
By tuning the regularization parameter (alpha), Ridge Regression can effectively handle multicollinearity and improve model generalization.
3. Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees.
Random Forest models are known for their robustness, scalability, and ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

#Model Evaluation

The performance of each regression model is evaluated using various metrics, including:

1. R-squared (R2): A measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
2. Adjusted R-squared: Similar to R-squared but adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A measure of the differences between predicted values and observed values.
4. Cross-validation scores: Average performance scores obtained through k-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness.

#Results and Discussion

The results of the regression models are analyzed and compared to identify the most accurate predictor of traffic flow. Insights gained from the analysis can inform decision-making processes related to traffic management, infrastructure planning, and urban development.
